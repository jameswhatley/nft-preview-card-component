## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS 
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to do the image overlay. In addition, about setting the opacity of the alpha channel of the background for the overlay to change the opacity of the background but not the containing image.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp) - This helped me with the image overlay.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15449280/making-text-background-transparent-but-not-text-itself) - This helped me with setting the opacity of the overlay background without impacting the image inside.
